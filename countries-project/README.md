# Where In The World Project React + TypeScript 

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. To run this application you want to CD into countries-project
and run npm run dev in the terminal this will provide a local host port which you can paste into a browser and see the application. I used react router and a few custom hooks.My favorite part of this project was implemting the Country Context custom hook. 

## Overview

This project displays knowledge of HTML,CSS,and TypeScript/JavaScript and the React Library/framework I am also utilizing the REST Countries API.

## My Process 

## MVP Goals 

Users should be able to:

See all countries from the API on the homepage
Search for a country using an input field
Filter countries by region
Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
Click through to the border countries on the detail page
